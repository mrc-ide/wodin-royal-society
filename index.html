        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are actions, apart from getting 
        vaccinated and taking medicine, that people and communities can take to help 
        slow the spread of illnesses like pandemic influenza or COVID-19. These actions 
        include things like social distancing, mask-wearing, and quarantining.</p>

        <h4>Modelling Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions</h4>
        <p>This tool enables the user to explore the potential impact of a range of 
        non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on a potential outbreak of a respiratory 
        pathogen.</p>

        <h5>Disease Transmission</h5>
        <p>The tool simulates how a respiratory virus spreads within a population. People 
        start in the “susceptible” category (S), meaning they are healthy but at risk of 
        catching the disease. If they are exposed to someone infectious, they move into 
        the “exposed” group (E), where they carry the virus but are not yet infectious 
        themselves. From here, they either develop symptoms and move into the 
        “symptomatic infected” group (I), or they stay without symptoms and move into 
        the “asymptomatic” group (A). Asymptomatic individuals all eventually recover (R), 
        but symptomatic people might be hospitalized (H), and hospitalized people can 
        either recover (R) or die (D). The model tracks how many people are in each 
        disease stage over time.</p>

        <h5>NPI Effects</h5>
        <p>The tool allows the user to explore the potential impact of NPIs that work in 
        the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Reducing overall transmission:</strong> This could represent 
          measures like lockdowns or restrictions that apply to everyone, which make it 
          harder for the virus to spread from one person to another.</li>
          <li><strong>Reducing contact rates for specific age groups:</strong> Some 
          measures target particular age groups to reduce their exposure, such as closing 
          schools or protecting older adults by reducing interactions between different 
          generations.</li>
          <li><strong>Reducing infectiousness of those who are sick:</strong> This 
          focuses on lowering the chance that someone with the virus will pass it on to 
          others. It might involve isolating people with symptoms or ensuring those who 
          test positive stay at home.</li>
          <li><strong>Reducing the importation of new cases:</strong> This intervention 
          reduces the number of infections brought into a community from outside, such as 
          through travel restrictions or quarantine for people entering the country.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The user can specify the time at which NPIs are implemented, and how effective 
        they are, and explore their potential impact for a range of disease profiles.</p>
