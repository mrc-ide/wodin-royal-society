**Using infectious disease models to support decisions on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) implementation in managing future pathogens with pandemic potential**

</h2>

### **1. Aim of infectious disease modelling**

Infectious disease modelling plays a crucial role in understanding and predicting the spread of pathogens. The primary purpose of these models is to capture how an infectious disease spreads through a population and to provide insight into how various interventions might alter the course of an outbreak. By simulating different scenarios, models allow us to evaluate the potential impact of measures such as isolation and quarantine. These insights are particularly valuable in shaping public health responses during an outbreak, guiding decisions that aim to mitigate the spread of a new pathogen and reduce its impact on the population.

### **2. What are infectious disease models?**

The framework of infectious disease models is built upon assumptions about how individuals move through different stages of infection and how they interact with others in a population. These models aim to capture the transition of individuals between health states – such as being susceptible to infection, becoming infected, and eventually recovering or remaining infectious – and to represent how these transitions contribute to the overall spread of the disease. The models use these assumptions to describe and predict the dynamics of an outbreak, allowing public health officials to understand how an infectious disease progresses over time within a community.

In addition to understanding disease dynamics, models are powerful tools for assessing the potential impact of interventions. They can be used to simulate a variety of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as social distancing, isolation, and quarantine, and their effects on disease spread. For example, models help to determine how effective isolating symptomatic individuals might be in reducing transmission, or how measures like lockdowns that reduce social contact can slow the rate of new infections. By exploring different intervention strategies and their likely outcomes, models provide essential insights into the most effective ways to control and mitigate the impact of infectious diseases.

### **3. Infectious Disease Models for Viral Respiratory Pathogens**

A widely used type of infectious disease model is the compartmental model, which breaks down the population into different categories based on disease state. A classic example is the SEIR model, where individuals are classified as Susceptible (S) if they can be infected, Exposed (E) if they have been infected but are not yet infectious, Infectious (I) when they can transmit the disease to others, and Recovered (R) once they have gained immunity or are no longer infectious. This structure helps to simplify and conceptualise the complex process of disease transmission. By modelling how individuals transition between these compartments, compartmental models allow researchers to understand the underlying mechanisms that drive the spread of disease and to predict how an outbreak will unfold.

### **4. Using the model for a specific pathogen**

Infectious disease models are designed to mirror the specific biological and epidemiological characteristics of a pathogen. This process, known as parameterisation, involves setting key parameters that capture how a disease spreads, how quickly it progresses, and how it affects different segments of the population. For respiratory viruses like COVID-19, a range of parameters is crucial to accurately reflect how the virus behaves and to predict its impact.

One of the fundamental parameters is the basic reproduction number, or R₀, which indicates how transmissible the virus is. R₀ represents the average number of secondary infections generated by one infected individual in a fully susceptible population. A higher R₀ suggests a more contagious pathogen, necessitating more robust control measures to curb its spread. Another key parameter is the incubation period, which is the time between exposure to the virus and the onset of symptoms. Understanding this period helps to estimate how quickly the virus spreads through a population and how soon after exposure an individual might become infectious.

|:----------------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|
|       **R0 (Basic Reproduction Number)**       |                  Measures how contagious a pathogen is by indicating the average number of secondary infections caused by one infected individual in a fully susceptible population. A higher R0 implies greater transmissibility.                  |
|             **Incubation Period**              |                     The time between exposure to the pathogen and the onset of symptoms. This period determines how quickly a pathogen spreads and can influence how long an individual is infectious before symptoms develop.                      |
|             **Symptomatic Period**             |               The duration during which an infected individual exhibits symptoms of the disease. The length of this period can affect the likelihood of identifying and isolating cases, influencing the success of control measures.               |
| **Percentage of Incubation Period Infectious** | The proportion of the incubation period during which an infected person is capable of transmitting the pathogen. This is critical for understanding the potential for pre-symptomatic transmission and designing effective intervention strategies. |
|   **Proportion of Asymptomatic Infections**    |                              The percentage of infected individuals who do not show symptoms but can still transmit the pathogen. This affects the overall transmission dynamics and may complicate control measures.                               |
|         **Severity by Age (IHR/IFR)**          |         Infection Hospitalisation Rate (IHR) and Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) describe the likelihood of an individual requiring hospital care or dying from the infection, often varying by age group and other individual risk factors.          |

### **5. Epidemiological Parameterisation for COVID-19**

To effectively model the spread and impact of a specific pathogen, it is necessary to gather and analyse a variety of data sources. For a comprehensive understanding, these can include line-list data, which provides case-by-case information on infected individuals; clinical symptom data, which captures the spectrum of illness experienced by those infected; case numbers, reflecting the scale and growth of the outbreak; and infection outcome data, detailing the progression of disease and rates of recovery or mortality. These diverse sources are used to parametrise models, ensuring that they accurately represent the biological and epidemiological features of the disease.

In the case of COVID-19, the parameterisation process was dynamic and continuously refined as new data emerged throughout the pandemic. Early on, estimates were based on initial observations from outbreaks in China and other countries, and these parameters evolved over time as more data became available and the scientific understanding of the virus deepened. This iterative process was crucial for maintaining model accuracy in predicting the spread and informing public health strategies.

This led to rapid virus spread.                   |

|   **Proportion of Asymptomatic Infections**    |   Approximately 30-35%   |                   Around 30-35% of infections were asymptomatic, yet still capable of spreading the virus to others【INQ000249526†source.

|    **Infection Hospitalisation Rate (IHR)**    | \~4.4% (average for UK)  |                     The proportion of infected individuals requiring hospitalisation was approximately 4.4%, with higher rates among older age groups and those with underlying conditions​(INQ000249526).                      |
|       **Infection Fatality Rate (IFR)**        |  \~1% (average for UK)   | The average proportion of all infections resulting in death was around 1% in the UK population, but this rate increased significantly with age, particularly affecting the elderly and those with comorbidities​(INQ000249526). |

### **6. Epidemiological parameters for different viral respiratory pathogens**

Different pathogens have distinct characteristics in terms of transmission dynamics, incubation periods, and severity, highlighted by comparing three notable viral respiratory pathogens: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-1), influenza, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). The table below summarises key epidemiological parameters for each pathogen.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

These parameters illustrate the differences in transmission dynamics and severity across pathogens, and help understand how to design appropriate public health strategies. For example, SARS-1 could be effectively controlled through isolating symptomatic individuals due to the limited pre-symptomatic transmission. On the other hand, influenza’s shorter incubation period and higher pre-symptomatic transmission requires broader interventions to reduce spread. RSV's higher R0, in combination with increased rates of pre-symptomatic transmission amongst children necessitates targeted paediatric responses.

### **7. Overview of Non-pharmaceutical interventions**

Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are critical tools for reducing the transmission of infectious diseases by targeting specific aspects of how they spread. They can be categorised into four main strategies: reducing transmission probability, modifying contact rates within and between age groups, decreasing the infectiousness of individuals, and limiting the importation of new cases. Each type of intervention plays a distinct role in outbreak control, and they are often used together for maximum effect.

#### **Reduction to the Transmission Probability**

These interventions aim to decrease the likelihood that any given contact will lead to transmission. Universal measures like national or local lockdowns, work-from-home mandates, and public event bans fall into this category. By reducing overall movement and social interactions, these interventions broadly lower transmission rates across the entire population. Less stringent approaches like implementing mask mandates in public spaces, reducing gathering sizes, and restricting the operation of non-essential businesses can also contribute to reducing transmission probability while allowing some social and economic activities to continue.

#### **Reduction to (Age) Group Contact Rates**

Some NPIs specifically target contact rates within certain demographics or age groups to reduce the spread within these populations. For example, school closures limit interactions among children, while measures like curfews or restricted hours for businesses reduce contacts among other age groups. Age-based shielding, such as encouraging elderly or vulnerable populations to minimise social interactions, is another example. Closing bars, gyms, or places where specific age groups tend to gather can significantly reduce transmission within those settings. These targeted interventions allow for a more focused reduction in transmission while aiming to minimise broader societal disruption.

#### **Reduction in Infectiousness of a Disease State**

Interventions in this category aim to reduce the infectiousness of individuals who are already carrying the pathogen. Key measures include isolation of symptomatic individuals, which prevents onward transmission once someone is known to be infectious. Testing strategies, such as widespread PCR or rapid antigen testing, help identify cases early so that they can be isolated quickly. Other interventions like mask-wearing reduce the likelihood of transmission from both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. These interventions are especially effective when there is a timely response, and they are adhered to consistently.

#### **Reduction to Importation Rate**

Measures to reduce the importation of cases focus on limiting the introduction of the disease into a population from external sources. Travel restrictions, such as bans on international or domestic travel, mandatory quarantines for travellers, and pre-travel testing requirements, are all examples of such interventions. These measures can delay the introduction of a new pathogen and prevent re-seeding in areas where transmission has been controlled. However, their effectiveness depends on rapid implementation, consistent enforcement, and coordination with other domestic NPIs to reduce local spread.

### **8. Non-Pharmaceutical Parameterisation for COVID-19**

The impact that each of these interventions will have depends on a number of factors (the severity of the pathogen, the level of public adherence with guidelines, the stringency of restrictions etc). While many of these interventions were implemented during the UK response to the COVID-19 pandemic, accurately estimating the impact of different interventions on disease transmission is a challenging task. This is because often interventions were implemented at the same time as other interventions, making it harder to quantify the contribution of each intervention, and some interventions, like lockdowns, inherently encompass others, such as school and workplace closures.

The estimates provided in the table below represent a range of possible impacts of different interventions if implemented for COVID-19 on their own. While some studies, like the one by Sharma et al. (Nature Communications, 2021), attempt to isolate the effects of individual NPIs, there is no comprehensive approach or study that can account for the full range of interventions and estimate their combined impact on transmission. Therefore the table below is provided to help provide an indication of the range of impacts that an individual NPI could have and guide the user when selecting a value for each of the NPI intervention levers. Given the difficulty of deciding on a specific estimate for each of the levers, especially when considering different respiratory viral pathogens (most of these interventions have only been studied in the context of COVID-19), the “Sensitivity” tab allows users to compare the impact of different values for each NPI lever.
